## Biography

I am currently an LLM Researcher at **Alibaba Group**. My research interests lie at the intersection of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Agentic Systems**.

I have been leading and contributing to several influential projects, including <span style="color:#e67e22; font-weight:600;">ROME</span> (an open-source agentic model ecosystem) and <span style="color:#e67e22; font-weight:600;">ROLL/ROLL Flash</span> (high-performance RL training frameworks). My goal is to build autonomous agents that can reason, self-refine, and interact effectively with complex real-world environments.

## News

- **[2026.02]** Released a blog post on "Agentic False Positives and Environment Augmentation".
- **[2026.01]** Launched **ROME** as part of the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE).
